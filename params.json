{"body":"# What is BFColorPickerPopover?\r\n\r\nBFColorPickerPopover is a subclass of NSPopover that includes the standard OS X color picker user interface. This helps reducing the inspector window and panel clutter on the screen, as the popover sticks to the content it belongs to.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ag4uN.png)\r\n\r\n# What are the requirements?\r\n\r\nBFColorPickerPopover was writhed using ARC and Modern Objective-C.\r\nARC (with weak references) is supported since OS X 10.7.\r\nFor Modern Objective-C you'll need Xcode 4.4 or later and LLVM.\r\n\r\n# How do I use it in my project?\r\n\r\nDrag the folder BFColorPickerPopover into your your project in Xcode.\r\nChoose \"Create groups for any added folders and make sure your target is checked.\r\nBFColorPickerPopover is a singleton class. Use [BFColorPickerPopover sharedPopover] to access it. The reason for this is, that it uses NSColorPanel to create it's GUI and there is only one shared NSColorPanel available per app.\r\nYou can use the usual showRelativeToRect:ofView:preferredEdge: method of NSPopover to show the shared BFColorPickerPopover instance. But there is also a subclass of NSColorWell included (BFPopoverColorWell) that already handles presenting the popover when needed.\r\nCheck out the example application for both approaches.\r\n\r\n# How can I reach you?\r\n\r\nYou can e-mail me at balazsfaludi@gmail.com or contact me on AIM via balazsfaludi@sunrise.ch.
